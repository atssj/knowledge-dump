# Useful Lesser-Known Docker Commands

This document summarizes some helpful Docker commands that might not be commonly used.

## Docker Commands

- `docker system df`: This command displays disk space usage by Docker images, containers, local volumes, and build cache.

- `docker system prune`: This command removes unnecessary data, including stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and build cache.

- `docker image prune`: This command specifically targets and removes all dangling images - leftover images from previous pulls not associated with running containers.

- `docker image prune -a`: This command extends `docker image prune` by removing all untagged images, not just dangling ones.

- `docker context`: This command suite deals with managing remote Docker environments. It allows connecting to Docker daemons on other machines.

 - `docker context list`: Lists all configured Docker contexts.
 - `docker context create`: Creates a new Docker context.
 - `docker context use`: Switches the active Docker context.

- `docker cp`: This command facilitates copying files between your local machine and a container.

- `docker logs -f`: This command follows the logs generated by a container in real-time.

- `docker exec`: This command allows you to execute a command directly within a running container.

- `docker run --rm -it netshoot`: This command runs the netshoot container image, which provides a pre-configured environment with common Linux utilities for troubleshooting network issues.

- `docker network connect`: This command connects a container to a specific network.

- `docker ps -a`: This command lists all containers, including those in a stopped state.
